" To correct for multiple comparisons in multiple hypothesis testing for the 845 taxonomical allowed FunCats, we calculated the Bonferroni correction as well as the False discovery rate (FDR) control with an experiment-wide significance level alpha of 0.05. The table is sorted by the p-value (k position). You will find as filter the holding criteria B=Bonferroni correction < 0.05, F:p-value < False discovery rate and  *:p-value < 0.05."
