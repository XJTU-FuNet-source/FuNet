  <p>Novel traits, such as overcoming host resistance to establish infection, or utilizing different nutrient sources to support growth in a changing Novel traits, such as overcoming host resistance to establish infection, or utilizing different nutrient sources to support growth in a changing environment, are important for the adaptation of an organism and, in many cases, are gained through the acquisition of new genes. The integration of these new genes into the regulatory network is crucial for their functionality. And we can divide the genes of F. graminearum into FS gene and core gene, and the FS genes and core genes are 3600 and 9700 respectively.</p>

  <p>Fisher's exact test is a statistical significance test used in the analysis of contingency tables. We first count the number of FS genes and the number of core genes in each module, then we use the Fisher¡¯s exact test to examine P value. We used logarithm multiplied by 10 times to visualize the P value, and those exceeding the threshold - 13 were the conservative or non-conservative enrichment modules. We can get 8 FS modules in which FS genes were significantly enriched and we can also get 24 core modules in which core genes were significantly enriched, since we are using the Fisher's double-ended test. We will find that the probability that the FS regulators appear in the FS modules is much greater than the probability that the FS regulators appear in the core modules.</p>
